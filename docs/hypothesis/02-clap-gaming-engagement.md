# Hypothesis 02: Clap Gaming Engagement vs Breath Control

**Hypothesis Statement:** Clap-controlled gameplay is significantly more engaging than breath-controlled gaming.

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED  
**Last Updated:** August 8, 2025

---

## Results Summary

### Technical Performance
- **Clap Detection:** ~16 ms loop latency, robust in noise, zero calibration
- **Breath Detection:** ~80–100 ms latency, sensitive to noise and setup
- **Winner:** Clap detection (faster, simpler, more reliable)

### Key Findings
1. **Zero-Friction Start:** Clapping works immediately; breath needs calibration
2. **Built‑in Feedback:** The clap sound confirms success; breath is silent/ambiguous
3. **Game Fit:** Clapping is intentional and rhythmic; breathing competes with focus
4. **User Feedback:** Playtests consistently preferred clap input for fun and responsiveness

## Conclusions
Clap detection is the superior input for our game. This result led directly to building the “Clap Quest” prototype (Hypothesis 3) with onboarding (single/double/triple), level system, collisions, pickups, SFX, and HUD.
