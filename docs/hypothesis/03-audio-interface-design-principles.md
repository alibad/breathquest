# Hypothesis 03: Universal Bio-Interface Design Principles

**Hypothesis Statement:** The breath vs clap comparison reveals universal principles for designing successful biological interfaces and can be embodied in a delightful, playable demo (“Clap Quest”).

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Game + Principles)  
**Last Updated:** August 8, 2025

---

## Outcome
- Built the “Clap Quest” mini‑game: onboarding (single/double/triple), pause/mic UI, collisions, targets, collectibles, levels, best‑score persistence, SFX, particles, clouds.
- Used the game to validate the following principles in the wild.

## The Seven Principles
1. **Natural Feedback** – Interface provides inherent confirmation (clap sound vs silent breath)
2. **Intentional Boundaries** – Discrete, controllable actions (clap timing vs continuous breathing)
3. **Zero‑Friction Onboarding** – No setup required (claps work immediately vs breath calibration)
4. **Cognitive Conservation** – Minimal mental overhead
5. **Social Appropriateness** – Gestures fit context (celebratory claps)
6. **Technical Performance** – Sub‑frame latency and high precision
7. **Error Transparency** – Failures are obvious and recoverable

## Validation Links
- H1 – Breath detection is technically feasible but UX‑fragile → pivot catalyst
- H2 – Claps outperform breath for gaming → green‑light for game design

## Applications
- Accessibility inputs, audio interfaces, and casual gaming controls.

## Impact
A compact framework + demo for predicting/validating bio‑interfaces in products.
