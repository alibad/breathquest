# Phase 3: Gaming-Focused Personal Calibration Design

## üéØ Vision: Personal Breathing Profile for Gaming Precision

**Goal:** Learn each user's unique breathing signature and save it as a persistent profile for dramatically improved gaming control.

## üßò Breathing Exercises (From Protocols Database)

### 1. Breath Assessment Protocol
**Purpose:** Understand user's natural breathing style
**From:** `protocols.json` - "breath-assessment"

**Exercise Flow:**
```
1. "Breathe normally for 1 minute while we observe your pattern"
2. Questions: 
   - "Were you breathing through nose or mouth?"
   - "Did your belly or chest move first?"
3. Feedback:
   - Diaphragmatic breathing: "Great! You have good breath control"
   - Chest breathing: "Let's work on belly breathing for better gaming control"
   - Mouth breathing: "Try nose breathing for calmer, more focused gaming"
```

### 2. Box Breathing (Navy SEALs Focus Training)
**Purpose:** Establish controlled, focused breathing for gaming
**From:** `protocols.json` - "box-breathing"

**Exercise Flow:**
```
"This is the breathing technique Navy SEALs use for focus under pressure"
1. Inhale through nose for 4 seconds
2. Hold breath for 4 seconds  
3. Exhale through mouth for 4 seconds
4. Hold empty for 4 seconds
5. Repeat 4 cycles

"We'll map your 4-4-4-4 pattern for gaming focus mode"
```

### 3. Balanced Breathing (Nervous System Balance)
**Purpose:** Create steady baseline for consistent gaming
**From:** `protocols.json` - "balanced-breathing"

**Exercise Flow:**
```
"This creates nervous system balance for consistent gaming performance"
1. Inhale deeply through nose for 5 seconds
2. Exhale slowly through mouth for 5 seconds
3. Repeat 10 cycles

"We'll use this as your steady gaming baseline"
```

### 4. Personal Gaming Range Mapping
**Purpose:** Map user's personal min/max breath intensities

**Exercise Flow:**
```
"Now we'll map YOUR unique breathing range for gaming"

üå¨Ô∏è Quiet Breathing:
"Breathe as quietly as possible for 30 seconds"
‚Üí Records: Personal minimum amplitude for stealth/idle

üí® Maximum Inhale:
"Take the deepest breath you can comfortably sustain"
‚Üí Records: Personal maximum inhale for power attacks

üî• Sharp Exhale:
"Give me your fastest, sharpest exhale - like blowing out birthday candles"
‚Üí Records: Personal maximum exhale for quick actions

‚è∏Ô∏è Comfortable Hold:
"Hold your breath as long as comfortable - don't strain"
‚Üí Records: Personal hold duration for shields/stealth
```

### 5. Optimal Gaming Distance Calibration
**Purpose:** Find user's best microphone positioning

**Exercise Flow:**
```
"Let's find your perfect gaming distance"

üìè Distance Testing:
1. Close (30cm): "Breathe normally" ‚Üí Test detection quality
2. Arm's length (60cm): "Breathe normally" ‚Üí Test detection quality  
3. Extended (90cm): "Breathe normally" ‚Üí Test detection quality

üéØ Optimal Position:
"Based on your tests, your optimal gaming distance is: 60cm"
"This gives you the best balance of detection and comfort"
```

## üíæ Personal Breathing Profile Storage

### Profile Structure
```typescript
interface PersonalBreathingProfile {
  // User Info
  userId: string;
  username: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  
  // Breathing Style Assessment
  breathingStyle: {
    primaryRoute: 'nose' | 'mouth' | 'mixed';
    breathingType: 'diaphragmatic' | 'chest' | 'mixed';
    naturalRhythm: number; // breaths per minute
  };
  
  // Personal Amplitude Ranges (calibrated to user's microphone)
  amplitudeRanges: {
    quiet: number;        // Stealth/idle gaming
    normal: number;       // Regular movement
    deepInhale: number;   // Power attacks
    sharpExhale: number;  // Quick actions
    maxHold: number;      // Shield/stealth duration (seconds)
  };
  
  // Gaming Focus Patterns
  gamingPatterns: {
    focusBreathing: 'box' | 'balanced' | 'custom';
    preferredPattern: {
      inhale: number;     // seconds
      hold: number;       // seconds  
      exhale: number;     // seconds
      pause: number;      // seconds
    };
  };
  
  // Optimal Setup
  optimalSetup: {
    microphoneDistance: number; // cm
    environmentNoise: number;   // baseline noise level
    calibrationQuality: number; // 0-100 confidence
  };
  
  // Gaming Thresholds (personalized)
  gameThresholds: {
    stealthThreshold: number;   // Below this = stealth mode
    normalThreshold: number;    // Normal game movement
    powerThreshold: number;     // Above this = power attacks
    quickActionSensitivity: number; // Exhale detection speed
  };
}
```

### Profile Persistence
```typescript
// Save Profile
localStorage.setItem(
  `breathquest_profile_${username}`, 
  JSON.stringify(personalProfile)
);

// Load Profile
const savedProfile = localStorage.getItem(`breathquest_profile_${username}`);
if (savedProfile) {
  personalProfile = JSON.parse(savedProfile);
  applyPersonalCalibration(personalProfile);
}
```

## üéÆ Gaming Integration

### Profile-Based Gaming Mode
```typescript
// When user starts gaming with saved profile
function initializePersonalizedGaming(profile: PersonalBreathingProfile) {
  // Apply personal thresholds instead of generic ones
  breathDetection.setThresholds({
    stealth: profile.gameThresholds.stealthThreshold,
    normal: profile.gameThresholds.normalThreshold,
    power: profile.gameThresholds.powerThreshold,
    quickAction: profile.gameThresholds.quickActionSensitivity
  });
  
  // Set optimal microphone distance reminder
  showSetupGuide(`Position device ${profile.optimalSetup.microphoneDistance}cm away`);
  
  // Enable focus breathing reminder
  if (gaming.stressed) {
    suggestFocusBreathing(profile.gamingPatterns.preferredPattern);
  }
}
```

## üöÄ User Experience Flow
