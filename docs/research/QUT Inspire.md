## Abstract

### Introduction
A new smartphone app (QUT Inspire) has been developed to detect inspiratory sound and deliver virtual incentive spirometry (ISy), a respiratory therapy technique used in postoperative recuperation, management of some chronic conditions and with potential applications in SARS-CoV-2 rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to compare the usability of this new app with a clinical ISy device as measured by effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.

### Methods
In this mixed-methods randomised usability study, healthy volunteers (aged 39.2±12.2 years, n=24) compared inspirations using the QUT Inspire app and a Triflo II clinical ISy device. A post-test questionnaire and a semi-structured interview explored dimensions of usability regarding the new app.

### Results
The duration of inspirations performed using the QUT Inspire app (7.3±2.0 s) were comparable with use of the Triflo II ISy device (7.5±2.3 s). No artefacts arising from the order of device testing were identified. App users held their phones adjacent but not proximal to their mouths (13.6±6.4 cm), notwithstanding instructions to keep the phone less than 5 cm away for optimal breath sound detection. The use of onscreen text or video instructional materials did not result in a significant reduction in this distance. Participants reported clear preferences for the app (100%, n=24) to motivate persistence with repeated inspirations. App gamification features such as a timer (75%, n=18) and breath counter (83.3%, n=20) were well regarded.

### Conclusion
This study demonstrates that a virtual ISy app can be effective, efficient and have high satisfaction. Improvements informed by this research include use of additional phone sensors to optimise sound detection and minimising the distance that phones are held from the user's mouth. Further research in randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate performance of this app in clinical contexts where ISy is currently employed.

## What is Already Known on This Topic
- Virtual incentive spirometry (ISy) is a novel emergent mHealth technology but little is known about the usability of apps compared with longstanding clinical devices for this respiratory therapy.

## What This Study Adds
- This study contributes knowledge regarding the usability of a new virtual ISy app compared with a clinical incentive spirometer device.

## How This Study Might Affect Research, Practice and/or Policy
- A paucity of evidence regarding safety and efficacy presents barriers to more widespread adoption of mHealth apps for prescription by clinicians to patients. Evidence from this study may contribute to broader adoption of ubiquitous smartphone technology for health improvement.

## Introduction

Developed in the 1970s, incentive spirometers are motivational devices designed to engage patients to persist with repeated gradual maximal inspirations for respiratory therapy. The original purpose for this therapy was encouragement to produce inspirations which mimicked a yawn or a sigh, intended to reinflate collapsed alveoli (ie, alveolar atelectasis) arising as a side effect from surgical anaesthesia or protracted periods of postoperative recuperation in bed.

Designed as a 'bedside reminder' for patients to practice deep inhalations, applications for incentive spirometry (ISy) therapy now encompass prevention of chest infections and pneumonia due to mucus build-up in the airways, including chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Recent reports also indicate a potential emergent role for ISy in rehabilitation for SARS-CoV-2 patients.

ISy therapy may decrease ventilation/perfusion mismatch and atelectasis in patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory distress syndrome.

## Methods

### Study Design
The usability of the new QUT Inspire virtual incentive spirometer mHealth app was investigated in this study using a mixed-methods randomised usability approach. Usability was measured according to effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction.

### Participants
- **Sample size:** n=24 healthy volunteers
- **Age:** 39.2±12.2 years
- **Recruitment:** Queensland university and community organizations (May-June 2021)
- **Exclusion criteria:** Pre-existing medical conditions preventing gradual maximal inspiration

### Patient and Public Involvement
The design of this research was informed in part by insights gained from an earlier Master of Public Health dissertation by Clarence Baxter in 2018 regarding user impressions concerning an initial design prototype of the app. Users in this earlier study reported a preference for more responsive graphic animations in response to inspiratory effort. The app was updated based on feedback received.

### Phase 1: Randomised Usability Study
Participants were randomly assigned to use either the Triflo II ISy device or the new QUT Inspire app first, then the other device. Prior to testing the app, participants were randomly assigned to view onscreen text or a short instructional video.

**Effectiveness measures:**
- Duration of inspirations using stopwatch
- Only data from highest of three comparable inspirations recorded

**Efficiency measures:**
- Distance between phone and mouth measured with ruler

### Phase 2: Qualitative Usability Study
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants after completion of quantitative testing. All interviews were digitally recorded and analysed using inductive thematic analysis with axial coding.

## Results

### Participant Demographics
- **Gender:** 58% female, 42% male
- **Age range:** 21-64 years
- **Education:** 58% high school, 25% undergraduate degree, 17% postgraduate degree
- **Phone type:** 58% Apple, 42% Android
- **Prior ISy knowledge:** 70.8% had no prior knowledge of ISy

### Statistical Analysis and Findings

**Effectiveness:**
- No significant difference found between duration of inspirations using QUT Inspire app vs Triflo II device
- App inspiration duration: 7.3±2.0 seconds
- Triflo II inspiration duration: 7.5±2.3 seconds

**Efficiency:**
- Participants held phones 13.6±6.4 cm from their mouths (first use) and 9.2±5.7 cm (second use)
- Few participants held phones at optimal distance (<5 cm)
- Instructional materials (text vs video) did not significantly reduce distance

**Device Order Effects:**
- A device order effect was identified regarding inspiratory flow rates (IFRmax) using the Triflo II device
- Higher mean IFRmax when Triflo II used first (1176.9±83.2 cc/s) vs second (1036.4±156.7 cc/s, p=0.018)

### Post-test Questionnaire Results
- **100% agreed:** App was user friendly
- **100% agreed:** Liked app layout
- **100% agreed:** Easily able to complete 3 inhalations
- **83.3% agreed:** Similar effort required for app and clinical device
- **87.5% agreed:** Understood screen/video instructions
- **75.0% agreed:** Timer provided motivation
- **83.3% agreed:** Attempt counter was useful

### Qualitative Findings

Four main themes were identified:

#### 1. Visual Reward from Responsive App Animations
Most participants preferred the virtual app for displaying inspirations, noting:
- Quicker responsiveness to inspiratory sound
- Immediate visual feedback
- Compactness when using smartphone

> "The phone ... [app] responded quicker ... worked when I breathed in .... it jumped up and stayed up ..." (Participant 4, male, aged 21 years)

#### 2. Clinical Look-and-Feel Influencing Credibility
Participants noted similarities between clinical device and virtual app display:
- Professional appearance enhanced credibility
- Some concern about app looking like a "game"

> "I was impressed by the smartphone [app]. It looks like the medical one and shows my breaths on the screen." (Participant 18, female, aged 58 years)

#### 3. Perceived Effort Affecting Engagement
- Some participants found app easier to use than clinical device
- Others preferred clinical device due to greater required effort
- Mixed preferences based on individual perceptions of therapeutic benefit

#### 4. Selective Adoption of Gamification Features
- Timer and breath counter generally well received
- Some participants too focused on main display to notice gamification features
- Additional incentive provided by tracking features

> "Yes, the counter was good for to keeping track of your breathing." (Participant 7, female, aged 49)

## Discussion

### Key Findings
In its many incarnations, ISy embodies key tenets of 'serious gaming' called therapeutic exergaming. The new QUT Inspire app is a skeuomorphic design which presents a virtualised representation of a traditional clinical flow-based ISy device.

### Usability Assessment
The study evaluated usability according to ISO standards:
- **Effectiveness:** Measured by duration of sustained inspiratory effort
- **Efficiency:** Assessed using distance participants held phones from mouths
- **Satisfaction:** Investigated through qualitative interviews

### Technical Considerations
- App uses smartphone microphone as uncalibrated pressure sensor
- Optimal sound detection at distances ≤5 cm
- Adjustable microphone sensitivity to eliminate background noise
- HTML5 web app compatible with Apple and Android devices

### Limitations
- Study cohort skewed toward adults and mature persons
- Only three inhalations performed vs clinical prescription of 10
- Healthy participants may not represent clinical populations
- No children or adolescents included

## Future Research

Key observations for future development:
1. **Proximity sensors:** Modern smartphones could warn if phone too far from user
2. **Adjustable difficulty:** Inspiratory effort can be increased by adjusting sound threshold
3. **Enhanced features:** Larger fonts, additional animation styles, smartwatch compatibility
4. **Clinical trials:** Safety and efficacy studies in relevant patient populations

## Conclusion

Development of an mHealth app such as QUT Inspire is an iterative process. This study demonstrates that usability testing with healthy subjects contributes further insights into the operation of this app 'in the wild'. These insights contribute to improvements in the app, with particular reference to optimising distance between the user and their phone for inspiratory sound detection and improving the user interface.

The study shows that a virtual ISy app can be effective, efficient and have high user satisfaction compared to traditional clinical devices. Following evaluation of this app using subjects with relevant health conditions potentially amenable to ISy therapy is a logical next step in asserting that the app is safe and effective.
